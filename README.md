Python Project Setup Script
===========================

About
-----
The `setup.sh` script in this repo checks for the `virtualenv` and `pip` 
binaries, creates a new `virtualenv`, and installs `pip-accel` and `pynt` into 
it.

The reason I'm putting this up here is because I found that every time I started
a new project, I did the previously described steps. So I though, why not
automate it.

It doesn't do much, but it's nice to have around :)
